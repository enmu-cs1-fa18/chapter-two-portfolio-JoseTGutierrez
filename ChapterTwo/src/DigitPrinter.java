	 * 	  Use final int MY_NUMBER = 349; 
	 *    Then use mod and integer division to break the number into pieces 
	 *    so you can print out each digit separately. 
	 *    (You should be able to change the value of MY_NUMBER 
	 *    to a different number and not have to change anything else in your code. 
	 *    When you re-execute your 
	 *    code, the output should match your changed value of MY_NUMBER.)
	 *    Print the first digit on one line, the second digit on the next line, and the third digit on the 
	 *    last line. Be sure to put some text before the digit that explains what it is.
	 *    The code should work for any value of MY_NUMBER up to 3 digits.
